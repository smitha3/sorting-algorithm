#HEAP SORT

#This project to used to perform heap sort

#prerequisites

#This project requires microsift visual studio 2019 or previous version to run

  The min_heap function used in the program, recursively goes through the tree, then gets implemented that implies the given property.
  void min_heapify(int arr[], int n, int i)
{
  

    /* If left child is smaller than root */
  

    /* If right child is smaller than smallest so far*/
    
    /* If smallest is not root */
  
    /* Recursively heapify the sub-tree */
     
}

#This project has the code, which will ask you to input elements, then 
  the heap algorithm used in program, sort the input item
